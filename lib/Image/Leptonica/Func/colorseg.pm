=head2 pixAssignToNearestColor

l_int32 pixAssignToNearestColor ( PIX *pixd, PIX *pixs, PIX *pixm, l_int32 level, l_int32 *countarray )

  pixAssignToNearestColor()

      Input:  pixd  (8 bpp, colormapped)
              pixs  (32 bpp; 24-bit color)
              pixm  (<optional> 1 bpp)
              level (of octcube used for finding nearest color in cmap)
              countarray (<optional> ptr to array, in which we can store
                          the number of pixels found in each color in
                          the colormap in pixd)
      Return: 0 if OK, 1 on error

  Notes:
      (1) This is used in phase 2 of color segmentation, where pixs
          is the original input image to pixColorSegment(), and
          pixd is the colormapped image returned from
          pixColorSegmentCluster().  It is also used, with a mask,
          in phase 4.
      (2) This is an in-place operation.
      (3) The colormap in pixd is unchanged.
      (4) pixs and pixd must be the same size (w, h).
      (5) The selection mask pixm can be null.  If it exists, it must
          be the same size as pixs and pixd, and only pixels
          corresponding to fg in pixm are assigned.  Set to
          NULL if all pixels in pixd are to be assigned.
      (6) The countarray can be null.  If it exists, it is pre-allocated
          and of a size at least equal to the size of the colormap in pixd.
      (7) This does a best-fit (non-greedy) assignment of pixels to
          existing clusters.  Specifically, it assigns each pixel
          in pixd to the color index in the pixd colormap that has a
          color closest to the corresponding rgb pixel in pixs.
      (8) 'level' is the octcube level used to quickly find the nearest
          color in the colormap for each pixel.  For color segmentation,
          this parameter is set to LEVEL_IN_OCTCUBE.
      (9) We build a mapping table from octcube to colormap index so
          that this function can run in a time (otherwise) independent
          of the number of colors in the colormap.  This avoids a
          brute-force search for the closest colormap color to each
          pixel in the image.

=head2 pixColorSegment

PIX * pixColorSegment ( PIX *pixs, l_int32 maxdist, l_int32 maxcolors, l_int32 selsize, l_int32 finalcolors )

  pixColorSegment()

      Input:  pixs  (32 bpp; 24-bit color)
              maxdist (max euclidean dist to existing cluster)
              maxcolors (max number of colors allowed in first pass)
              selsize (linear size of sel for closing to remove noise)
              finalcolors (max number of final colors allowed after 4th pass)
      Return: pixd (8 bit with colormap), or null on error

  Color segmentation proceeds in four phases:

  Phase 1:  pixColorSegmentCluster()
  The image is traversed in raster order.  Each pixel either
  becomes the representative for a new cluster or is assigned to an
  existing cluster.  Assignment is greedy.  The data is stored in
  a colormapped image.  Three auxiliary arrays are used to hold
  the colors of the representative pixels, for fast lookup.
  The average color in each cluster is computed.

  Phase 2.  pixAssignToNearestColor()
  A second (non-greedy) clustering pass is performed, where each pixel
  is assigned to the nearest cluster (average).  We also keep track
  of how many pixels are assigned to each cluster.

  Phase 3.  pixColorSegmentClean()
  For each cluster, starting with the largest, do a morphological
  closing to eliminate small components within larger ones.

  Phase 4.  pixColorSegmentRemoveColors()
  Eliminate all colors except the most populated 'finalcolors'.
  Then remove unused colors from the colormap, and reassign those
  pixels to the nearest remaining cluster, using the original pixel values.

  Notes:
      (1) The goal is to generate a small number of colors.
          Typically this would be specified by 'finalcolors',
          a number that would be somewhere between 3 and 6.
          The parameter 'maxcolors' specifies the maximum number of
          colors generated in the first phase.  This should be
          larger than finalcolors, perhaps twice as large.
          If more than 'maxcolors' are generated in the first phase
          using the input 'maxdist', the distance is repeatedly
          increased by a multiplicative factor until the condition
          is satisfied.  The implicit relation between 'maxdist'
          and 'maxcolors' is thus adjusted programmatically.
      (2) As a very rough guideline, given a target value of 'finalcolors',
          here are approximate values of 'maxdist' and 'maxcolors'
          to start with:

               finalcolors    maxcolors    maxdist
               -----------    ---------    -------
                   3             6          100
                   4             8           90
                   5            10           75
                   6            12           60

          For a given number of finalcolors, if you use too many
          maxcolors, the result will be noisy.  If you use too few,
          the result will be a relatively poor assignment of colors.

=head2 pixColorSegmentClean

l_int32 pixColorSegmentClean ( PIX *pixs, l_int32 selsize, l_int32 *countarray )

  pixColorSegmentClean()

      Input:  pixs  (8 bpp, colormapped)
              selsize (for closing)
              countarray (ptr to array containing the number of pixels
                          found in each color in the colormap)
      Return: 0 if OK, 1 on error

  Notes:
      (1) This operation is in-place.
      (2) This is phase 3 of color segmentation.  It is the first
          part of a two-step noise removal process.  Colors with a
          large population are closed first; this operation absorbs
          small sets of intercolated pixels of a different color.

=head2 pixColorSegmentCluster

PIX * pixColorSegmentCluster ( PIX *pixs, l_int32 maxdist, l_int32 maxcolors )

  pixColorSegmentCluster()

      Input:  pixs  (32 bpp; 24-bit color)
              maxdist (max euclidean dist to existing cluster)
              maxcolors (max number of colors allowed in first pass)
      Return: pixd (8 bit with colormap), or null on error

  Notes:
      (1) This is phase 1.  See description in pixColorSegment().
      (2) Greedy unsupervised classification.  If the limit 'maxcolors'
          is exceeded, the computation is repeated with a larger
          allowed cluster size.
      (3) On each successive iteration, 'maxdist' is increased by a
          constant factor.  See comments in pixColorSegment() for
          a guideline on parameter selection.
          Note that the diagonal of the 8-bit rgb color cube is about
          440, so for 'maxdist' = 440, you are guaranteed to get 1 color!

=head2 pixColorSegmentRemoveColors

l_int32 pixColorSegmentRemoveColors ( PIX *pixd, PIX *pixs, l_int32 finalcolors )

  pixColorSegmentRemoveColors()

      Input:  pixd  (8 bpp, colormapped)
              pixs  (32 bpp rgb, with initial pixel values)
              finalcolors (max number of colors to retain)
      Return: 0 if OK, 1 on error

  Notes:
      (1) This operation is in-place.
      (2) This is phase 4 of color segmentation, and the second part
          of the 2-step noise removal.  Only 'finalcolors' different
          colors are retained, with colors with smaller populations
          being replaced by the nearest color of the remaining colors.
          For highest accuracy, for pixels that are being replaced,
          we find the nearest colormap color  to the original rgb color.
