  The Sobel edge detector uses these two simple gradient filters.

       1    2    1             1    0   -1
       0    0    0             2    0   -2
      -1   -2   -1             1    0   -1

      (horizontal)             (vertical)

  To use both the vertical and horizontal filters, set the orientation
  flag to L_ALL_EDGES; this sums the abs. value of their outputs,
  clipped to 255.

  See comments below for displaying the resulting image with
  the edges dark, both for 8 bpp and 1 bpp.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 pixGetEdgeProfile

NUMA * pixGetEdgeProfile ( PIX *pixs, l_int32 side, const char *debugfile )

  pixGetEdgeProfile()

      Input:  pixs (1 bpp)
              side (L_FROM_LEFT, L_FROM_RIGHT, L_FROM_TOP, L_FROM_BOT)
              debugfile (<optional> displays constructed edge; use NULL
                         for no output)
      Return: na (of fg edge pixel locations), or null on error

=head2 pixGetLastOffPixelInRun

l_int32 pixGetLastOffPixelInRun ( PIX *pixs, l_int32 x, l_int32 y, l_int32 direction, l_int32 *ploc )

  pixGetLastOffPixelInRun()

      Input:  pixs (1 bpp)
              x, y (starting location)
              direction (L_FROM_LEFT, L_FROM_RIGHT, L_FROM_TOP, L_FROM_BOT)
              &loc (<return> location in scan direction coordinate
                    of last OFF pixel found)
      Return: na (of fg edge pixel locations), or null on error

  Notes:
      (1) Search starts from the pixel at (x, y), which is OFF.
      (2) It returns the location in the scan direction of the last
          pixel in the current run that is OFF.
      (3) The interface for these pixel run functions is cleaner when
          you ask for the last pixel in the current run, rather than the
          first pixel of opposite polarity that is found, because the
          current run may go to the edge of the image, in which case
          no pixel of opposite polarity is found.

=head2 pixGetLastOnPixelInRun

l_int32 pixGetLastOnPixelInRun ( PIX *pixs, l_int32 x, l_int32 y, l_int32 direction, l_int32 *ploc )

  pixGetLastOnPixelInRun()

      Input:  pixs (1 bpp)
              x, y (starting location)
              direction (L_FROM_LEFT, L_FROM_RIGHT, L_FROM_TOP, L_FROM_BOT)
              &loc (<return> location in scan direction coordinate
                    of first ON pixel found)
      Return: na (of fg edge pixel locations), or null on error

  Notes:
      (1) Search starts from the pixel at (x, y), which is ON.
      (2) It returns the location in the scan direction of the last
          pixel in the current run that is ON.

=head2 pixMeasureEdgeSmoothness

l_int32 pixMeasureEdgeSmoothness ( PIX *pixs, l_int32 side, l_int32 minjump, l_int32 minreversal, l_float32 *pjpl, l_float32 *pjspl, l_float32 *prpl, const char *debugfile )

  pixMeasureEdgeSmoothness()

      Input:  pixs (1 bpp)
              side (L_FROM_LEFT, L_FROM_RIGHT, L_FROM_TOP, L_FROM_BOT)
              minjump (minimum jump to be counted; >= 1)
              minreversal (minimum reversal size for new peak or valley)
              &jpl (<optional return> jumps/length: number of jumps,
                    normalized to length of component side)
              &jspl (<optional return> jumpsum/length: sum of all
                     sufficiently large jumps, normalized to length
                     of component side)
              &rpl (<optional return> reversals/length: number of
                    peak-to-valley or valley-to-peak reversals,
                    normalized to length of component side)
              debugfile (<optional> displays constructed edge; use NULL
                         for no output)
      Return: 0 if OK, 1 on error

  Notes:
      (1) This computes three measures of smoothness of the edge of a
          connected component:
            * jumps/length: (jpl) the number of jumps of size >= @minjump,
              normalized to the length of the side
            * jump sum/length: (jspl) the sum of all jump lengths of
              size >= @minjump, normalized to the length of the side
            * reversals/length: (rpl) the number of peak <--> valley
              reversals, using @minreverse as a minimum deviation of
              the peak or valley from its preceeding extremum,
              normalized to the length of the side
      (2) The input pix should be a single connected component, but
          this is not required.

=head2 pixSobelEdgeFilter

PIX * pixSobelEdgeFilter ( PIX *pixs, l_int32 orientflag )

  pixSobelEdgeFilter()

      Input:  pixs (8 bpp; no colormap)
              orientflag (L_HORIZONTAL_EDGES, L_VERTICAL_EDGES, L_ALL_EDGES)
      Return: pixd (8 bpp, edges are brighter), or null on error

  Notes:
      (1) Invert pixd to see larger gradients as darker (grayscale).
      (2) To generate a binary image of the edges, threshold
          the result using pixThresholdToBinary().  If the high
          edge values are to be fg (1), invert after running
          pixThresholdToBinary().
      (3) Label the pixels as follows:
              1    4    7
              2    5    8
              3    6    9
          Read the data incrementally across the image and unroll
          the loop.
      (4) This runs at about 45 Mpix/sec on a 3 GHz processor.

=head2 pixTwoSidedEdgeFilter

PIX * pixTwoSidedEdgeFilter ( PIX *pixs, l_int32 orientflag )

  pixTwoSidedEdgeFilter()

      Input:  pixs (8 bpp; no colormap)
              orientflag (L_HORIZONTAL_EDGES, L_VERTICAL_EDGES)
      Return: pixd (8 bpp, edges are brighter), or null on error

  Notes:
      (1) For detecting vertical edges, this considers the
          difference of the central pixel from those on the left
          and right.  For situations where the gradient is the same
          sign on both sides, this computes and stores the minimum
          (absolute value of the) difference.  The reason for
          checking the sign is that we are looking for pixels within
          a transition.  By contrast, for single pixel noise, the pixel
          value is either larger than or smaller than its neighbors,
          so the gradient would change direction on each side.  Horizontal
          edges are handled similarly, looking for vertical gradients.
      (2) To generate a binary image of the edges, threshold
          the result using pixThresholdToBinary().  If the high
          edge values are to be fg (1), invert after running
          pixThresholdToBinary().
      (3) This runs at about 60 Mpix/sec on a 3 GHz processor.
          It is about 30% faster than Sobel, and the results are
          similar.
