     Kernel helper function
          L_KERNEL            *makeRangeKernel()

  This includes both a slow, exact implementation of the bilateral
  filter algorithm (given by Sylvain Paris and FrÃ©do Durand),
  and a fast, approximate and separable implementation (following
  Yang, Tan and Ahuja).  See bilateral.h for algorithmic details.

  The bilateral filter has the nice property of applying a gaussian
  filter to smooth parts of the image that don't vary too quickly,
  while at the same time preserving edges.  The filter is nonlinear
  and cannot be decomposed into two separable filters; however,
  there exists an approximate method that is separable.  To further
  speed up the separable implementation, you can generate the
  intermediate data at reduced resolution.

  The full kernel is composed of two parts: a spatial gaussian filter
  and a nonlinear "range" filter that depends on the intensity difference
  between the reference pixel at the spatial kernel origin and any other
  pixel within the kernel support.

  In our implementations, the range filter is a parameterized,
  one-sided, 256-element, monotonically decreasing gaussian function
  of the absolute value of the difference between pixel values; namely,
  abs(I2 - I1).  In general, any decreasing function can be used,
  and more generally,  any two-dimensional kernel can be used if
  you wish to relax the 'abs' condition.  (In that case, the range
  filter can be 256 x 256).

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 makeRangeKernel

L_KERNEL * makeRangeKernel ( l_float32 range_stdev )

  makeRangeKernel()

      Input:  range_stdev (> 0)
      Return: kel, or null on error

  Notes:
      (1) Creates a one-sided Gaussian kernel with the given
          standard deviation.  At grayscale difference of one stdev,
          the kernel falls to 0.6, and to 0.01 at three stdev.
      (2) A typical input number might be 20.  Then pixels whose
          value differs by 60 from the center pixel have their
          weight in the convolution reduced by a factor of about 0.01.

=head2 pixBilateral

PIX * pixBilateral ( PIX *pixs, l_float32 spatial_stdev, l_float32 range_stdev, l_int32 ncomps, l_int32 reduction )

  pixBilateral()

      Input:  pixs (8 bpp gray or 32 bpp rgb, no colormap)
              spatial_stdev  (of gaussian kernel; in pixels, > 0.5)
              range_stdev  (of gaussian range kernel; > 5.0; typ. 50.0)
              ncomps (number of intermediate sums J(k,x); in [4 ... 30])
              reduction  (1, 2 or 4)
      Return: pixd (bilateral filtered image), or null on error

  Notes:
      (1) This performs a relatively fast, separable bilateral
          filtering operation.  The time is proportional to ncomps
          and varies inversely approximately as the cube of the
          reduction factor.  See bilateral.h for algorithm details.
      (2) We impose minimum values for range_stdev and ncomps to
          avoid nasty artifacts when either are too small.  We also
          impose a constraint on their product:
               ncomps * range_stdev >= 100.
          So for values of range_stdev >= 25, ncomps can be as small as 4.
          Here is a qualitative, intuitive explanation for this constraint.
          Call the difference in k values between the J(k) == 'delta', where
              'delta' ~ 200 / ncomps
          Then this constraint is roughly equivalent to the condition:
              'delta' < 2 * range_stdev
          Note that at an intensity difference of (2 * range_stdev), the
          range part of the kernel reduces the effect by the factor 0.14.
          This constraint requires that we have a sufficient number of
          PCBs (i.e, a small enough 'delta'), so that for any value of
          image intensity I, there exists a k (and a PCB, J(k), such that
              |I - k| < range_stdev
          Any fewer PCBs and we don't have enough to support this condition.
      (3) The upper limit of 30 on ncomps is imposed because the
          gain in accuracy is not worth the extra computation.
      (4) The size of the gaussian kernel is twice the spatial_stdev
          on each side of the origin.  The minimum value of
          spatial_stdev, 0.5, is required to have a finite sized
          spatial kernel.  In practice, a much larger value is used.
      (5) Computation of the intermediate images goes inversely
          as the cube of the reduction factor.  If you can use a
          reduction of 2 or 4, it is well-advised.
      (6) The range kernel is defined over the absolute value of pixel
          grayscale differences, and hence must have size 256 x 1.
          Values in the array represent the multiplying weight
          depending on the absolute gray value difference between
          the source pixel and the neighboring pixel, and should
          be monotonically decreasing.
      (7) Interesting observation.  Run this on prog/fish24.jpg, with
          range_stdev = 60, ncomps = 6, and spatial_dev = {10, 30, 50}.
          As spatial_dev gets larger, we get the counter-intuitive
          result that the body of the red fish becomes less blurry.

=head2 pixBilateralExact

PIX * pixBilateralExact ( PIX *pixs, L_KERNEL *spatial_kel, L_KERNEL *range_kel )

  pixBilateralExact()

      Input:  pixs (8 bpp gray or 32 bpp rgb)
              spatial_kel  (gaussian kernel)
              range_kel (<optional> 256 x 1, monotonically decreasing)
      Return: pixd (8 bpp bilateral filtered image)

  Notes:
      (1) The spatial_kel is a conventional smoothing kernel, typically a
          2-d Gaussian kernel or other block kernel.  It can be either
          normalized or not, but must be everywhere positive.
      (2) The range_kel is defined over the absolute value of pixel
          grayscale differences, and hence must have size 256 x 1.
          Values in the array represent the multiplying weight for each
          gray value difference between the target pixel and center of the
          kernel, and should be monotonically decreasing.
      (3) If range_kel == NULL, a constant weight is applied regardless
          of the range value difference.  This degenerates to a regular
          pixConvolve() with a normalized kernel.

=head2 pixBilateralGray

PIX * pixBilateralGray ( PIX *pixs, l_float32 spatial_stdev, l_float32 range_stdev, l_int32 ncomps, l_int32 reduction )

  pixBilateralGray()

      Input:  pixs (8 bpp gray)
              spatial_stdev  (of gaussian kernel; in pixels, > 0.5)
              range_stdev  (of gaussian range kernel; > 5.0; typ. 50.0)
              ncomps (number of intermediate sums J(k,x); in [4 ... 30])
              reduction  (1, 2 or 4)
      Return: pixd (8 bpp bilateral filtered image), or null on error

      (1) See pixBilateral() for constraints on the input parameters.

=head2 pixBilateralGrayExact

PIX * pixBilateralGrayExact ( PIX *pixs, L_KERNEL *spatial_kel, L_KERNEL *range_kel )

  pixBilateralGrayExact()

      Input:  pixs (8 bpp gray)
              spatial_kel  (gaussian kernel)
              range_kel (<optional> 256 x 1, monotonically decreasing)
      Return: pixd (8 bpp bilateral filtered image)

  Notes:
      (1) See pixBilateralExact().

=head2 pixBlockBilateralExact

PIX* pixBlockBilateralExact ( PIX *pixs, l_float32 spatial_stdev, l_float32 range_stdev )

  pixBlockBilateralExact()

      Input:  pixs (8 bpp gray or 32 bpp rgb)
              spatial_stdev (> 0.0)
              range_stdev (> 0.0)
      Return: pixd (8 bpp or 32 bpp bilateral filtered image)

  Notes:
      (1) See pixBilateralExact().  This provides an interface using
          the standard deviations of the spatial and range filters.
      (2) The convolution window halfwidth is 2 * spatial_stdev,
          and the square filter size is 4 * spatial_stdev + 1.
          The kernel captures 95% of total energy.  This is compensated
          by normalization.
      (3) The range_stdev is analogous to spatial_halfwidth in the
          grayscale domain [0...255], and determines how much damping of the
          smoothing operation is applied across edges.  The larger this
          value is, the smaller the damping.  The smaller the value, the
          more edge details are preserved.  These approximations are useful
          for deciding the appropriate cutoff.
              kernel[1 * stdev] ~= 0.6  * kernel[0]
              kernel[2 * stdev] ~= 0.14 * kernel[0]
              kernel[3 * stdev] ~= 0.01 * kernel[0]
          If range_stdev is infinite there is no damping, and this
          becomes a conventional gaussian smoothing.
          This value does not affect the run time.
      (4) If range_stdev is negative or zero, the range kernel is
          ignored and this degenerates to a straight gaussian convolution.
      (5) This is very slow for large spatial filters.  The time
          on a 3GHz pentium is roughly
             T = 1.2 * 10^-8 * (A * sh^2)  sec
          where A = # of pixels, sh = spatial halfwidth of filter.
